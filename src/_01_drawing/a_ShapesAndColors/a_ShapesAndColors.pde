// 1. Run this empty program 
// The grey square that appears has sides that are 100 pixels long

// 2. Code a size command to make it big enough for your picture

//    The size command looks like this:      
  size (500,500);
//    Try putting different numbers in the parentheses.
//    See if you can figure out which number is the width, and which is the height


// 3. Now add an ellipse command to draw a circle. An ellipse is like an oval.

//    The ellipse command looks like this:      
 ellipse(250,400, 200,200);
ellipse(250,300, 150,150);
ellipse(250,225, 100,100);
fill(#010505);
rect(185,170, 135,15);
rect(212,90, 80,90);
ellipse(270,220, 15,15);
ellipse(230,220, 15,15);
fill(#FF850A);
triangle(240,230,250,260,260,230);





// 6. The next shape you draw will be in the color you selected. 
//    NOTE: You have to put the fill command with the color you want, 
//    BEFORE you draw the shape.

// 7. Now use all these shapes and colors to draw a picture of your own design. 

// MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR CODE
